Dear Sir or Madam,

I am excited to apply for this role, as it combines my passion for data-driven product development with my experience in managing complex initiatives across fintech, blockchain, and AI projects. What motivates me most is turning data into actionable insights that improve products, support decisions, and create measurable business value.

In my current role as Product Manager at IDCanopy, I coordinate cross-functional teams to develop and scale identity verification and eKYC products. This means balancing technical, compliance, and business needs while keeping everyone aligned on clear KPIs and outcomes. Before that, I was a co-founder at susteam, where I managed both product and business development to digitize ESG reporting for the hospitality sector.

Outside of work, I have put my skills to the test in hackathons, winning and placing in competitions around AI, sustainability, and fintech. These fast-paced challenges taught me how to quickly prototype, challenge assumptions, and deliver results under pressure â€” skills I bring into every project.

Best regards,
